# Enjoy The Bite

## Description

This project was created so that the user is able to create their own profile with and review restaurants that they enjoyed. The users are also able to view other user's reviews. This project uses both the front end and backend applications. For the backend we used sequalizer, bcrypt, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, and mysql2. 
The user is able to get on the initial web page and will be greeted with a list of previous  reviews from other users.  The user will then have to create an account in order to create their own reviews on a restaurant. Once the user is logged in they will be able to view their previous posts, create new posts and comment on other users posts.
